## Headings (#, ##): For clear and structured job descriptions.
## Blockquotes (>): To highlight important notes or company values.
## Tables: To neatly organize information like salary ranges or qualifications.
## Icon Placeholders (e.g., :check:): I will add support for :check: to render a checkmark icon within lists. Add this to description formats.md so in future a markdown formation of description use it coding
